ActiveSet (constrained):
An Active Set Quadratic Program solver designed for this problem.

BlockCoordinate (scaled):
A method that optimizes parameters blocks (uses another scaled solver as a
sub-routine).

Constrained (constrained or scaled, depending on mode):
Formulates the problem as a constrained optimization problem (4 different
ways), and uses a generic constrained solver (3 solvers available).

GaussSeidel (scaled):
A method that optimizes individual parameters, choosing the parameter that is
furthest from the first-order optimality condition (bottom-up and top-down
strategy implemented).

Grafting (scaled):
A method that optimizes a set of working parameters with standard unconstrained
optimization using sub-gradients, and introduces parameters incrementally
(ie. bottom-up).

IteratedRidge (scaled):
An EM-like algorithm that solves a sequence of ridge-regression problems (4
strategies to deal with instability and 3 strategies to solve ridge problem
available).

IterativeSoftThresholding (scaled, where norm(X) is less than or equal to 1):
A fixed-point algorithm that repeatedly applies the soft-threshold 
operator to the current weight vector moved in the direction of steepest descent.

LARS (constrained)*:
Uses a version of the LARS algorithm where we stop at the desired value of
lambda.

NonNegativeSquared (scaled):
Uses a reformulation in terms of non-negative-squared variables, that can be
solved with an unconstrained optimizer.

PrimalDualLogBarrier (scaled):
An Interior Point Quadratic Program solver designed specifically for this
problem.

Projection (scaled):
Uses a bound-constrained formulation, solved with a second-order
gradient-projection strategy.

Shooting (scaled):
A method that optimizes individual parameters, cycling through them in order.

SignConstraints (constrained):
The algorithm of Tibshirani, where a sequence of Quadratic Programs are solved,
each having 1 additional constraint.

SubGradient (scaled):
A sub-gradient strategy based on the first-order optimality conditions.

UnconstrainedApx (scaled):
Uses a smooth approximation to |w|_1, and solves with an unconstrained
optimizer (3 approximations available).  Also implements a strategy where the
approximation is deformed into |w|_1 to speed convergence.
